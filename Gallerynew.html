                likely heard of eyeshadow primer, but what exactly does it do? “If you have oilier eyelids and your eyeshadow creases, a primer will nip that in 
                the bud,  said celebrity makeup artist Renée Loiz. Primers take away the oil and smoothen out the surface, ensuring whatever you apply on top of it 
                will stay in place. But do you have to use a specific eye primer? Celebrity makeup artist Jamie Dorman said concealers can work well if they're 
                silicone-based and if you dust with a bit of powder before applying your eyeshadow. If you have oily eyelids, Loiz recommended primer for keeping 
                oil at bay instead of adding another creamy texture to the eye." onclick="FullView(this.src, this.getAttribute('desc'))">

                prettier frame you get. There are many purposes of cutting and styling hair. One of the important purposes is hair health. Regular trimming keeps 
                hair healthy. *A good hairstyle can make you look younger. Your hairstyle could actually take years off. There are hairstyles (such as bangs and 
                bobs) that can bring your youth back. On the other hand, wrong haircut and hairstyle can make you look older. Thus, it is very much important to 
                choose your hairstyle wisely. *Haircut and hairstyle trends change time to time. In order to look good, it is important to go with the flow of 
                fashion. An outdated hairstyle can ruin your appearance. On the other hand, a fashionable hairstyle can make you look trendy. *Also, not every 
                haircut and hairstyle looks good on everyone. Different hairstyles are suitable for different face shapes. Instead of following celebrity hairstyle 
                trends, you should choose a hairstyle that your hairstylist recommends. These professionals know which haircut and hairstyle will look best on you."

                ability to have children. In turn, this makes female fertility one of the markers of human beauty."

                actors and actresses use so their features look better in bright or harsh stage lights. Within each of the three general classifications, 
                individuals may use products designed for facial skin, the eyes, lips or nails, including lipstick, foundation, blush, mascara, eyeshadow,

                more positively than blonde hair. Everyone has their preferences when it comes to the looks of ideal partners. Some might prefer people of a 
                certain body type, with rounder or longer faces or perhaps with hair of a particular length. However, as it turns out, it's not only a matter 
                of simple preference. Instead, genes are involved in the decision-making process. As a result, some people view long hair as a sign of youth and
